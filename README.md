 
This repository contains all data related to experiments made for the paper "Classification and evaluation of the algorithms for vector bin packing", published in COR and available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054824003320.

Note that this repository also contains materials for experiments in 1 dimension, which is a work in progress.

Repository content
------------------

All instance files, for the 3 benchmarks 'Panigrahy', 'New' and 'Triplet' are found in `data`, along with their generation script in Python.

The `results_data` folder contains:

- All result files, storing the solution found for every algorithm applied to every instance (files named `Panigrahy_multidim_full.csv`, `New_multidim_full.csv` and `Triplet_multidim.csv`)
- Summary files (named `<benchmark_name>_summary_known.csv`) containing, for each instance, the value of the lower bound (`LB`), the optimal value (`OPT`) if known or `-1` otherwise , and the best known solution for each main family of algorithm (`best_overall` for all algorithms, `best_IC` for all item-centric algorithms, `best_BC` for all bin-centric algorithms, `best_MB-Pairing` for all MB-Pairing algorithms, and `best_MB-WFD` for all MB-WFD and MB-BFD algorithms).
- In folder `notebooks` the Jupyter notebooks used for analysis of results
- In folder `plots` the plots generated by the notebooks

The `src` folder contains the source files used to run the algorithms and generate the result files.
The program relies on the `Vectorpack_cpp` library that implements all algorithms, available at https://github.com/Vectorpack/Vectorpack_cpp.
